A running coding task now says how it's doing. The harness contract gains an optional `onActivity` hook (`HarnessActivityHook`), called with each completed assistant message and each tool call a run starts; `claudeCodeAgent`, `codexAgent` and `cursorAgent` (tool calls only) take it, and `reportHarnessActivity` / `harnessActivityOf` in `@flow-state-dev/core` map a harness's events to it. `harnessManager` hands the feed and keeps the task's `statusNote` set to the run's latest activity: the first at once, then at most one write per `PROGRESS_NOTE_MS` (30 s), fenced by the run's claim. A slot that builds its harness from named feeds must pass `onActivity` through to get notes (FIX-2290).
