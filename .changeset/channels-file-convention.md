"@flow-state-dev/workforce": patch
---

Channels can be declared in files: `readChannelsDirectory(root)` on the `@flow-state-dev/workforce/loader` subpath reads each `teams/<id>/channels/<name>/CHANNEL.md` into a `ChannelManifest` that `channelInstances` and `openChannels` already take, collecting per-path failures instead of throwing (FIX-1352).
