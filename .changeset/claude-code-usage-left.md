See how much of Claude Code's subscription is used. Core's `HarnessUsageWindow` gains `level` (`ok`, `warning`, `reached`, or `null`) and its `usedPercent` may be `null` when a harness sends no percent; core adds `HarnessUsageHook` and `HarnessUsageReport`, the run-time twin of `HarnessSessionHook`. `claudeCodeAgent` takes `onUsage` and hands it each window a run's `rate_limit_event` reports, with the run's account; `readClaudeUsage` reads who is signed in for the usage query, and `probeClaudeAccount` takes a `signal` that stops and closes the probe, and marks a `none` it got no answer for with `unanswered: true`. `@flow-state-dev/harness-manager` feeds `onUsage` at both of its harness slots (`HarnessFeeds.onUsage`, now required, so code that builds `HarnessFeeds` itself must add it), writing into the run owner's usage record, and keeps a stored record's account and windows together across a sign-in change. Codex windows now carry `level: null`. Shift Manager's Usage view shows Claude Code's windows, saying "limit reached" or "under Claude Code's warning line" where there is no percent (FIX-2142).
