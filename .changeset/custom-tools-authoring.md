Workers can call custom tools written as files. A `blocks/` folder registers a block name for the workers that can see it — the app's own folder for everyone, a team's for that team, a worker's own for that one seat — and a worker's `tools:` resolves a name nearest first. Registering does not grant use: the worker still names the block. `fsdev gen` exports the per-seat map as `seatBlocks`, which `hireWorkforce` now takes.

Migration: a worker kind that hand-declares the admission contract instead of composing `workerConfigSchema()` must add the new `seatTools` key, or it refuses its roster at startup naming that key (FIX-1416).
