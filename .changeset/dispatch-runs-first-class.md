Sessions a dispatcher ran work in are listable on their flow: `GET /sessions` takes `include=dispatch-runs` (off by default), `listSessions` takes `include`, `FlowNavigator` takes `includeDispatchRuns` and draws a run one level under the session that started it, the DevTool shows runs in the rail and inside a session's block tree on demand in place of its Children tab, and `requestHost.livenessOf` now also answers for a dispatch run under the caller's own principal, tenant, organization and flow instance rather than only for one beneath the asking session (FIX-1440).

The dispatch-run liveness arm compares the caller's organization against the active-request entry as well as the session record. Both comparisons are required: they read separately stamped rows, and a caller whose organization was not forwarded to the read matched only entries carrying no organization at all.
