New core block kind: `evaluator` (FIX-1554). It asks an evaluation model typed questions (`choice`, `score`, `boolean`) and returns typed answers, with the model's confidence when it reports one. Model strings resolve through your existing providers and gateways; models that can only generate are refused before any call. `BlockKind` and the trace's `blockKind` gain `"evaluator"`: code that switches on block kind should handle it. `ai` minimum raised to the first release with evaluation. `@ai-sdk/typesafe-ai` is an optional peer. `ModelResolver` gains an optional `resolveEvaluationModel`; a custom resolver without it runs generators as before and refuses evaluator model strings. Evaluation through Vercel's AI Gateway needs `@ai-sdk/gateway` 4.0.85 or later. `@flow-state-dev/testing` adds `mockEvaluationModel`.
