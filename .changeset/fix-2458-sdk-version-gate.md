The three coding harnesses refuse an SDK they weren't tested against, the same way, and their readiness checks say so first (FIX-2458).

- **claude-code:** the peer range for `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` is `>=0.3.316 <0.4.0` instead of `*`. `claudeCodeAgent` now refuses to build against an installed SDK outside that range, as Codex and Cursor already did. A different SDK version can change the wire this package translates, which shows up as malformed items. Install a version in the range.
- **claude-code, codex, cursor:** each readiness check now reports the SDK first. An SDK outside the tested range answers `ready: false` with a reason naming both versions. A missing SDK answers `ready: false` too. Either way the remedy is to install the tested range. `checkClaudeCodeReadiness`, `checkCodexReadiness` and `checkCursorReadiness(env, options)` take `readInstalledSdkVersion` for a host's own check. The block always reads the installed SDK, and there is still no option to bypass its refusal. New option types: `ClaudeCodeReadinessOptions`, `CodexReadinessOptions` and `CursorReadinessOptions`.
- **codex, cursor:** the version helpers leave the public entry: `TESTED_SDK_VERSION`, `assertTestedSdkVersion`, `readInstalledCodexSdkVersion` and `readInstalledCursorSdkVersion`, the `InstalledSdkVersion` and `InstalledSdkVersionReader` types, and `CodexSdkVersionMismatchError` and `CursorSdkVersionMismatchError`. They are removed, with no alias. To ask whether the SDK will run, call the package's readiness check. All three packages now throw the same refusal from core's SDK gate. Its `code` is `HARNESS_SDK_VERSION_MISMATCH`, replacing `CODEX_SDK_VERSION_MISMATCH` and `CURSOR_SDK_VERSION_MISMATCH`. The refusal is thrown when the block is built, never written into an item or stored.
- **core, claude-code, codex, cursor:** `engines.node` is now `>=22.3.0` (was `>=22`). Core's SDK gate reads the installed SDK through `process.getBuiltinModule`, which Node added in 22.3. On an older Node, the gate can't read the version and refuses the SDK.

Docs: packages/claude-code/README.md (the peer range, the build-time refusal, and readiness reporting the SDK), packages/codex/README.md and packages/cursor/README.md (the version helpers and mismatch classes are gone; readiness answers whether the SDK will run; the refusal's code is `HARNESS_SDK_VERSION_MISMATCH`), apps/docs/docs/tools/coding-agents.md (an unusable SDK is a readiness answer, the same for all three), apps/docs/docs/tools/cursor.md (the failure table names `HARNESS_SDK_VERSION_MISMATCH`, not a Cursor version class), apps/docs/docs/tools/claude-code-sdk.md (the supported SDK range)
