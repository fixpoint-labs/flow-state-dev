`harnessManager({ workspace })` accepts a workspace host from `@flow-state-dev/workspace` as well as a fixed `{ root, sourceRepo, baseRef }`, and provisions every run through the host either way. A run keeps the repository and base it started on (recorded on its run record) when its source later changes, and its kept files are saved at the end of each turn, when it asks a question, and when the harness fails. A run its workspace refuses (the source answers `refused`, or the host won't provision the remote) is cancelled on its first attempt instead of being retried, and `HarnessRunRefused` is exported. `localWorkspaceHost` gains `localRepositories`, for a repository on the machine that runs are cut from directly, with no clone and no fetch, and a place request can name a directory the checkout's repository must keep out of git, which a run with no repository also leaves out of its saved files. `run`, `GIT_TIMEOUT_MS` and `CHECKOUT_CLEANUP_TIMEOUT_MS` from `@flow-state-dev/harness-manager/checkout` are now re-exported from `@flow-state-dev/workspace` (FIX-1762).
