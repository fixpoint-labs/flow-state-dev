A settled item keeps the `itemIndex` it was added with. Both emitters re-read `ctx.response.getItemCount()` when closing an item the stream already held — a tool call settling with its result, and in `@flow-state-dev/claude-code` a streamed message or reasoning item closing, or a sub-agent container closing. The count does not grow when an existing item is closed, so the re-read returned the index the NEXT item was about to take, and two items in one request ended up sharing one. `itemIndex` orders a request's items and core's replay picks among same-id traces by the highest one, so the collision made that order a guess. `@flow-state-dev/cursor` already carried the opened index forward; these two now do the same.
