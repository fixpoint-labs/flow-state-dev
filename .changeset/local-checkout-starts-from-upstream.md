A repository listed in `localRepositories` now fetches the base's upstream and cuts a new run's branch from whichever of local and upstream is newer, refusing a base whose two copies have each moved as `base-diverged` and recording the commit cut at as `place.repo.baseCommit`, which the run record keeps and `readRunCommits` now counts a run's commits from (FIX-1927).
