Resource collections can be declared owner-private with `ownerPrivate: { param }`, and `ownerSegment(userId)` builds the owner key segment. Key segments beginning `~` are reserved for owner-private collections in every app, and flow registration refuses a single resource whose key has one. `defineResourceCollection` and flow registration no longer refuse collection patterns on Workforce's account, and `@flow-state-dev/core` no longer exports `assertRosterCollectionIsNotDeep`. Workforce's private roster collection is now owner-private; its refusal messages name the owner-private collection instead of the roster (FIX-1549).
