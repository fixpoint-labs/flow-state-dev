"@flow-state-dev/workforce": patch
---

Documents can be declared in files: `readResourcesDirectory(root)` on the `@flow-state-dev/workforce/loader` subpath reads `org/resources/<name>.md` and `teams/<id>/resources/<name>.md` into one record each, and `resourcesFromDocs(documents)` turns those records into the resource map you spread into `defineFlow({ resources })` (FIX-1354). A resource is a file rather than a folder, and where the file sits decides the document's scope and ref — so `scope`, `ref`, `stateSchema`, `default`, the content sources and a lazy `prefetchMode` are refused by name in frontmatter rather than quietly ignored.
