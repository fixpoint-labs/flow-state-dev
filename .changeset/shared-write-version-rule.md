`@flow-state-dev/contracts/helpers` (and `@flow-state-dev/core/helpers`) now export the resource-state version rule every `ResourceStateStore` adapter uses: `assertSetExpectedVersion`, `assertDeleteExpectedVersion` and `resourceStateConflict`, with the `ExpectedVersion`, `VersionedRow` and `VersionConflict` types. A custom store adapter can import them instead of copying the rule. `cloneValue` is now also exported from `@flow-state-dev/contracts/helpers`; its `@flow-state-dev/core/helpers` export is unchanged. No store's behaviour changes (FIX-1277).
