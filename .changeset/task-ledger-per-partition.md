`defineTaskCollection` accepts `partitionBy` on a `user`-scoped collection, keeping one set of rows per partition so each conversation's board reads, claims, waits on and settles only its own tasks while a board's hand-off carries the partition (core's task dispatch envelope gains an optional `partition`) to a task entry on another flow, whose gate and `taskLedgers` resolver read the row there (FIX-1794).
