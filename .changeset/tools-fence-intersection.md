FIX-1393: a generator's declared `tools:` is now a runtime fence over capability-contributed tools, not just a documented one.

A capability's tools used to be unioned onto whatever the block declared, so a block with `tools: []` could still be handed tools it never named. Declaring the slot now drops a capability's catalog-granted tools — `tools: []` reaches the model with none. Omitting `tools:` entirely is unchanged: it declares no fence, so capability tools still flow.

Capabilities declare tools through two slots. `tools` is a grant from the app's catalog and is fenced. The new `controlTools` is a framework control the consuming block's own configuration asked for, and the fence never touches it — a control is built inside its capability and never exported, so no `tools:` list could name it back in. One capability may use both: the skills library registers the app catalog through `tools` and its own skill loader through `controlTools`, and `taskTools` contributes the delegation board entirely as controls.

**Migration.** If you relied on a capability's tools arriving past a narrower `tools:` declaration, name them in `tools:` or drop the declaration. Pattern factories (`planAndExecute`, `supervisor`, `routedSpecialists`) forward both slots, so a call site passing `tools` and `uses` together now gets the fence inside the pattern. Capability authors whose tools are framework controls rather than catalog grants should move them to `controlTools`.
