Background work is declared with a task-board dispatcher seat and read back as child sessions: a session's children are listed at `GET /sessions/:sessionId/children` through `listChildSessions()` and `useSession`'s `childSessions` / `childSessionsStale`, session-scoped resources shared with them use `sharedToLineage`, and the two `createFlowState` options are `dispatchDrainTimeoutMs` and `maxChildSessionListLimit`; the Workstream surface they replace is removed, `ctx.requestHost.startDetached` and `dispatch: { mode: "detached" }` with it (FIX-1308). From `@flow-state-dev/orchestration/task-board` that removes the detached-mode helpers (`assertDetachedBoardSupported`, `detachedTaskPredicate`, `coordinateKey`, `coordinateLabel`, `workstreamRoutingSeed`, `WorkerCoordinate`, `TaskWorkerDispatch`, `TaskWorkerSlot`, `TaskWorkerSlotRegistry`, `TaskWorkerEntry`, `isTaskWorkerEntry`) and `board.detachedWorkers`; a seat is a block or a `dispatcher({ type: "task" })`, and `resolveWorkerSlots` now returns the bare blocks plus the `HandOffSeat`s (`name`, `label`, `dispatch`) in one walk from the hand-off module. A `{ worker, dispatch }` or `{ block, session }` seat is refused by name at construction. The DevTool's Children panel pairs a child with its task from the dispatch key a `per-task` or `per-worker` seat derives (a `{ key }` policy pairs nothing) and shows the entry it was dispatched for.
