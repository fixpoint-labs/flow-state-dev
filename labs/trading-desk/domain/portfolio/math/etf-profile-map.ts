/**

 * projection) into the pure look-through leaf's `FundProfileInput` discriminated
 * union (FIX-801 sub-PR c).
 *
 * The leaf's own header notes that `NormalizedFundProfile` mirrors
 * `NormalizedEtfProfile` FIELD-FOR-FIELD, so no PAYLOAD reshaping is needed — a
 * stored payload satisfies `NormalizedFundProfile` structurally as-is (TS
 * variable assignment tolerates its two extra fields, `netExpenseRatio` /
 * `inceptionDate`). What IS needed, and is genuinely shared by both consumers
 * (the Health pane, reading the route's client projection, and the analysis
 * seed, reading the repository row directly), is turning a flat "exactly one of
 * these two is non-null" row into the leaf's union + a ticker-keyed map — the
 * SAME judgment call twice would be exactly the kind of duplicated money-math
 * this codebase's `distill-lessons` pattern flags. One copy, here.
 *
 * Pure, no IO — takes plain data, not `db/repository.ts` or the route's response
 * types, so this stays a BP-019 leaf either caller can import without pulling in
 * a runtime dependency on the other's module graph.
