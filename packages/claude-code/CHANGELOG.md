# @flow-state-dev/claude-code

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 3cbc411: A shared contract for coding-agent harnesses (LAB-152), so a harness package no
  longer has to be built against another vendor's internals.

  `@flow-state-dev/core` now exports the shape a harness block is handed and the
  handle it returns — `harnessRunInputSchema` and `harnessRunHandleSchema` (plus
  `harnessRunEnvelopeSchema` for a fire-and-forget dispatch), with
  `HarnessRunInput`, `HarnessRunHandle`, `HarnessBlock`, `HarnessResolver` and
  `HarnessSessionHook` on `@flow-state-dev/core/types`. The handle names how a run
  ended (`outcome`: finished, stopped at a limit, or failed), its final message,
  usage, and cost — including whether that cost was reported by the agent or
  estimated. The input is the prompt alone: a working directory or a session to
  resume reaches a harness through a resolver the host supplies, not through a
  schema a model calling the block as a tool can see.

  `@flow-state-dev/claude-code`'s handles are the neutral ones plus Claude's own
  `resultSubtype` and `toolsObserved`. Two visible changes: `source` now reads
  `claude-code/sdk` and `claude-code/cli-remote` (the `<package>/<door>`
  convention every harness follows) and handles saved under the old `sdk` /
  `cli-remote` spellings still load; and the SDK handle carries `outcome` and
  `cost` alongside the existing `costUsd`, which stays for now. The package's
  `RemoteAgentTaskHandle`, `RemoteAgentSource`, `RemoteAgentStatus` and
  `remoteAgentTaskHandleSchema` are deprecated aliases of the core shapes.

- b3e6e22: Initial release (FIX-1187).
- 1b94521: Background Claude Code runs can continue a previous conversation (LAB-154).

  `claudeCodeAgent` and `createClaudeCodeAgentCapability` take `resume` (which
  session this run continues — return `null` to start fresh) and `onSession`
  (called during the run when the agent names its session, so a cancelled run's id
  is not lost). Both are background-path only and throw at construction without
  `detached: true`.

  Three things existing code can trip over:

  - **Every resolver option is now handed the block context alone.** `cwd`,
    `sandbox` and `resume` on `claudeCodeAgent`, and `root` on
    `createWorkspaceAgentCapability`, used to receive the run's input as a first
    argument. Drop it: `cwd: (_input, ctx) => …` becomes `cwd: (ctx) => …`.
  - **`costUsd` is gone from the SDK handle.** Read `cost.usd`. Handles already
    persisted with the old field still load.
  - **`HarnessResolver` in `@flow-state-dev/core/types` matches**, and its context
    keeps its types where it previously widened them to `any` — a resolver body
    reading an undeclared scope-state field no longer compiles.
