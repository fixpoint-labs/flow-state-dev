### Minor Changes

- afcac3d: A flow declares its `cardinality` — `"singleton"` (the default: `myFlow()` is the one instance, addressed by its kind, and `myFlow({ id: "default" })` now throws) or `"collection"` (several configured copies, each registered under its own required `id`) — every address (the action, stream, resume, retry and continue routes, `fsdev run`, dispatchers, BullMQ jobs, MCP, webhook and schedule dispatch) is the exact instance id with no first-registered fallback, every session and request records its owning `flowId` and is refused when reached through another instance (`FlowInstanceBindingMismatchError`; `409 wrong-instance-session` / `wrong-instance-request` / `migration-required` on the routes), and SQLite and Postgres add a nullable indexed `flow_id` column with no backfill (FIX-1321, FIX-1322).
- b3e6e22: Initial release (FIX-1187).
- fda9b15: Background work is declared with a task-board dispatcher seat and read back as child sessions: a session's children are listed at `GET /sessions/:sessionId/children` through `listChildSessions()` and `useSession`'s `childSessions` / `childSessionsStale`, session-scoped resources shared with them use `sharedToLineage`, and the two `createFlowState` options are `dispatchDrainTimeoutMs` and `maxChildSessionListLimit`; the Workstream surface they replace is removed, `ctx.requestHost.startDetached` and `dispatch: { mode: "detached" }` with it (FIX-1308). From `@flow-state-dev/orchestration/task-board` that removes the detached-mode helpers (`assertDetachedBoardSupported`, `detachedTaskPredicate`, `coordinateKey`, `coordinateLabel`, `workstreamRoutingSeed`, `WorkerCoordinate`, `TaskWorkerDispatch`, `TaskWorkerSlot`, `TaskWorkerSlotRegistry`, `TaskWorkerEntry`, `isTaskWorkerEntry`) and `board.detachedWorkers`; a seat is a block or a `dispatcher({ type: "task" })`, and `resolveWorkerSlots` now returns the bare blocks plus the `HandOffSeat`s (`name`, `label`, `dispatch`) in one walk from the hand-off module. A `{ worker, dispatch }` or `{ block, session }` seat is refused by name at construction. The DevTool's Children panel pairs a child with its task from the dispatch key a `per-task` or `per-worker` seat derives (a `{ key }` policy pairs nothing) and shows the entry it was dispatched for.

## Pre-1.0 history

Captured from the project's pre-Changesets development log (root `changelog.md`,
deleted on FIX-653). Entries are listed newest-first.

### 2026-05-07 — Lazy collection state, query interface, resource manifest (FIX-427) [BREAKING]

Client surface updated to match the new paginated list, single-item state, and manifest endpoints. Collection snapshots no longer carry an eager `items` map.

### 2026-05-06 — `clientData` privacy fix + rename (FIX-505) [BREAKING]

`FlowClient.state.getSessionState` / `getUserState` / `getOrgState` are removed — they were typed against the privacy-broken response. `getSnapshot` remains; read `clientData.<scope>` from it.

### 2026-04-30 — Connection resilience (FIX-476)

Client SSE parser detects `: ping` comment frames and fires a new `onHeartbeat` callback alongside regular events.

### 2026-04-28 — Interrupted-request recovery

New `createRecoveryClient` with `checkInterrupted` and `retry` methods.

### 2026-04-26 — Org scope rename (FIX-428) [BREAKING]

Client API renamed `project` → `org` across snapshot fields, scope helpers, and recovery routes.
