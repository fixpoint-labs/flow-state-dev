# @flow-state-dev/client

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 0554e0b: `@flow-state-dev/client` exports `readSessionTail`, `readSessionEarlier` and `refreshSessionWindow`: read a long session from its newest end, add earlier items on request, and read the window again, so a conversation past a few hundred items still shows its newest reply (FIX-2408).
- Updated dependencies [824ce87]
- Updated dependencies [387bee2]

  - @flow-state-dev/contracts@0.2.1

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 92b2b70: A conversation longer than its history window can keep what it said before the window (FIX-1613). `utility.historySummary({ summarize })` returns a `capability` for the generator that answers and a `fold` step to run before it: the fold writes the turns about to leave the window into a running summary, the capability hands that summary to the model and starts the generator's history after it. A capability preset may now declare `history` (a query added to that generator's history reads; generators only). The engine records `historyStart` on a request when earlier turns are out of view, exposes `ctx.session.window`, `ctx.session.items.turns()` and `history({ afterRequestId })`, and the client's request summary carries `historyStart`. Workforce's `defineAgentWorkerFlow` takes `beforeAnswer`, a block run before the worker answers.
- 5d31955: A flow can declare `reads`: blocks an app runs on a session to look at something the flow computes, stored nowhere. The engine serves them at `POST /:flowKind/:sessionId/reads/:readName`, answering `200 { output }` with no request record and no concurrency slot; any write a read's block tries is refused with `read_only`, and another user's session answers 404 as the action route does. The client calls one with `flow(kind).read(name, input, { sessionId })`. Orchestration adds `taskToolReads(collectionId, resolve)`, the `listTasks_<suffix>` listing as a read, and Workforce's coordinator and agent-worker flows now serve `listTasks_tasks` as a read, so an app polling a conversation's task board no longer stores a request per poll. The action of the same name is unchanged (FIX-2286).
- e2c190e: A running coding turn can take a message mid-turn (FIX-2254). Core declares the optional harness hook `onSteerable(steer | null, ctx)` (`HarnessSteer`, `HarnessSteerHook`): a harness whose run can take a line calls it with a `steer` that answers `"delivered"` or `"refused"`, and with `null` when the turn is over. `cursorAgent({ onSteerable })` offers Cursor's own run steering on local runs, through the `env` process too. The harness manager hands down `onSteerable` as an optional fifth feed; passed through, a message sent to the task while a step runs goes straight into that step, with no stop, extra step or new attempt. A line the run refuses is taken by the next step, as before.

  `autoResume: false` on an action (core's `ActionCore`, honoured by the engine) keeps a request on it from becoming its session's auto-resume target (`latestRequestId`), so a control sent beside a running request, such as that line, doesn't stop a reloading client from reattaching to the running one.

  Any app can steer a harness turn run in a session: `harnessSteering()` in core keeps each session's offer and builds the `steer` action (`{ taken, live }`), and the client's `sendHarnessLine` and `steerRunningTurn` send a typed line into the running turn, falling back to the next turn when it isn't taken.

- f6461ea: One client. `createClient({ userId, baseUrl?, apiPath?, fetcher? })` builds the only client: `flow(address)` sends actions (typed with `flow<typeof myFlow>(…)`), starts sessions and returns request handles; `sessions`, `resources`, `requests.interrupted()`, `stream` and `transcribe` hang off the client. A request handle has `status`, `wait`, `abort`, `continue`, `retry`, `resume` and `stream`, and `continue`/`resume` carry the run on under the same id. `fetcher` is the one transport every call and stream goes through, so the engine's `createInProcessFetch` reaches a host in the same process with no web server. Removed: `createTypedClient`, `createSessionClient`, `createResourceClient`, `createRecoveryClient`, `createSSEClient`, `createSessionSSEClient`, `createUserSSEClient`, the standalone `transcribe`, `flowKind` on `createClient`, and the `*Stream` method twins (pass `{ stream: true }` instead). `sessions.list` with no `userId` now lists the client's own user's sessions. Every failure is a `ClientHttpError`; `status: 0` means the client refused before sending (FIX-2162).
- 97894aa: A flow can check every new session's initial state with `session.createCheck`, refuse caller-seeded fields with `session.serverOwned`, and fix a field for a session's life by declaring it `.readonly()` in its session `stateSchema`; `listSessions({ state })` and the list route's `state.<field>` filter select sessions by a readonly field. On a flow that binds its sessions this way (a readonly field or a create check), an initial state that fails the `stateSchema` is refused on every path that creates a session; other flows keep it as sent. A dispatcher's `session: { key, state }` and a task dispatcher's `state` create the child session with that state. `ensureSessionRecord` now takes the create request beside the record it builds (FIX-1788).
- cd180d7: Stopping a paused request now ends it `aborted` and records its gate with the new `stopped` suspension status, a turn paused on an ask cancels the asked task instead of waiting for it, and a durable host now runs the durability sweeper even without `durabilityRetention`, so a paused request past its `expiresAt` expires and an ask past its deadline times out, while pruning still waits for a retention policy (FIX-1816).
- d97031f: The suspension reasons that wait for a user are now `"user_approval"` and `"user_input"`, renamed from `"human_approval"` and `"human_input"`. Nothing reads the old values: `SuspensionReason` still accepts any string, so a `ctx.suspend` or a `useSuspensions({ reasons })` filter that still passes an old value compiles but is treated as a custom reason: it is not a user's stop, gets no Inbox item, and an old `"human_input"` stop defaults to approve/reject instead of submit. Search your code for both old strings and replace them. Stored suspensions with the old reasons are not migrated (FIX-2151).
- 49d2aca: A stop that waits for a user holds its task and ends exactly once (FIX-2129).

  - **`ctx.suspendForUser({ kind, prompt, deadline? })`** (`core`): stop the request for an `approval`, a `review` or an `input`. It returns the answer, or `{ cancelled: true }` when the task was cancelled while it waited. At its deadline an approval reads as a no (`deadline: true`) and a review or an input throws `SuspensionTimeoutError`, which the block may catch. With no `deadline`, the host's `userDeadlineMs` applies, else none: the stop waits until it is answered, stopped or cancelled. The model's tool is `suspendForUser`; the task's open stop is listed on `Task.holds`.
  - **The answer route** (`engine`): `POST /api/flows/:flowKind/requests/:requestId/answer` answers a user's stop in any run, a task board's included, after the resume path's ownership checks; a request handle's `answer` (`client`) calls it. Who answered is the signed-in caller.
  - **`userDeadlineMs`** (`createFlowState`, `engine`): the host's deadline for a user's stop, unset by default.
  - **Cancel one stop:** `RequestHost.resumeWait({ suspension: { requestId, suspensionId }, outcome: { cancelled: true } })`.
  - `contracts` exports `isUserSuspension` and `suspendForUserKindOf`, and `SuspensionStatus` gains `"cancelled"`.

  A raw `ctx.suspend` with `user_approval` or `user_input` now gets the same mark, cancel and stop as `suspendForUser`. A raw `user_input` stop past its `timeoutMs` now resumes its block with `SuspensionTimeoutError` instead of staying parked, and a cancelled one throws `SuspensionRejectedError` with `cancelled: true`. A filing by a cancelled task is refused (`TaskFilingRefusedError`, rule `parent_cancelled`). Shift Manager answers every ask through the answer route.

### Patch Changes

- 585b75b: `POST /api/flows/users/:userId/check-interrupted` and `createRecoveryClient().checkInterrupted({ staleThresholdMs })` now use the larger of the caller's `staleThresholdMs` and the server's `staleSweepThresholdMs`, so a smaller, zero, or negative value sweeps as if it were left out and a request that is still heartbeating is never marked `interrupted` (to sweep sooner, lower `staleSweepThresholdMs` on the server) (FIX-1571).
- 49852d9: `abortRequest` now rejects with a `ClientHttpError` carrying the route's `status` (for example 409 when the request had already finished, 403 when it isn't yours), instead of a plain `Error`. The message is unchanged, so code that reads it keeps working (FIX-1664).
- 698e06b: New `apiPath` option on every client constructor and on `FlowProvider` names where the server mounts the flow API (default `/api/flows`), so the client and React hooks can reach a Node server started with a custom `basePath`. Requests go to `baseUrl` + `apiPath` + route; with `apiPath` unset, every URL is unchanged. The `@flow-state-dev/node` README documents pairing `basePath` with `apiPath` (FIX-1677).
- 60d1bf4: Request routes answer a caller from another organization with the same 404 an unused request id gets, so a request's existence no longer shows across organizations (FIX-2194). The resume route records the signed-in caller as who resumed a suspension (the request's owner when the app doesn't authenticate) and ignores a `resumedBy` in the body; `ResumeSuspensionBody.resumedBy` is deprecated (FIX-2195).
- 6a3ecf5: `@flow-state-dev/client` exports `readEveryCollectionPage`, one collection read with a single 1,000-page ceiling that fails when the server repeats a cursor, and the workforce panels, the DevTool Inventory tab, the Shift Manager and the workforce roster read now use it, so a repeated cursor ends a read with an error instead of 1,000 wasted page reads, a partial list shown as whole, or a read that never stops (FIX-1674).
- 65ddb90: Each request's record now stores its action result (`output` as JSON, and/or `error`) with its final status, `listSessionRequests` returns it (the output with `includeResultOutput`), the DevTool task row reads it instead of reconstructing it from traces, and a run a completion hook failed after the action answered now reports that answer as `output` (including `fsdev run`'s result, where it was `null`) (FIX-1661).
- 60c8192: `getItems()`, `RequestRecord.items` and item subscriptions return `RuntimeItem`, which is `OutputItem` plus trace rows: `block_trace`, `router_decision`, `state_snapshot` and `generator_step` (FIX-2054). Only types change. Runtime behaviour is the same.

  These signatures return or pass `RuntimeItem`, which can break code that expects `OutputItem`:

  - `ResponseEmitterHandle.getItems()` and the `subscribeToItems` listener and filter (core).
  - `ResponseEmitter.getItems()`, `RequestRecord.items` and `RequestStore.persistItems` (engine).
  - The `testItems` selectors that don't filter by type: `all()`, `sideChain()`, `main()`, `byAgent()` and `byVisibility()` (testing). They return trace rows when given them.

  To upgrade, type arrays and callbacks that receive these values as `RuntimeItem`, imported from `@flow-state-dev/core`. Where code needs an `OutputItem`, filter out the trace rows with a type guard:

  ```ts
  import type { RuntimeItem } from "@flow-state-dev/core";
  import type { OutputItem } from "@flow-state-dev/core/items";

  const TRACE = new Set([
    "block_trace",
    "router_decision",
    "state_snapshot",
    "generator_step",
  ]);
  const isOutputItem = (item: RuntimeItem): item is OutputItem =>
    !TRACE.has(item.type);

  const visible = emitter.getItems().filter(isOutputItem);
  ```

  `.waitForCondition` predicates and `wakeOn` filters keep their `OutputItem` types. These signatures accept `RuntimeItem` as well as `OutputItem`: `resolveItemVisibility` and `collapseToCanonicalLog` (contracts, re-exported by core), `testItems` (testing), and the filter that `onTaskChangeFor` returns (orchestration). Existing callers need no change.

  `RequestStreamStore` and `createRequestStreamStore` (client) take the row type as a parameter, defaulting to `OutputItem`, so existing stores are unchanged. A store seeded with trace rows is created as `createRequestStreamStore<RuntimeItem>()`, and its `getSorted()`, `getRaw()`, `getById()` and `getOwnedBy()` return `RuntimeItem`.

- b7c523b: Add `createSessionSSEClient(options)`, a client for the whole-session stream. It reconnects with backoff, handing back the last server time it heard, and stops without retrying when the server refuses the session (401, 403, or a 409 for a session that must be migrated first) or has no such route (FIX-1609).

  `createRequestStreamStore` takes an optional `keyOf`, the key each item is held under (default: its id). A store that holds more than one request's items keys by request and item id, since two requests can keep the same id.

  `SessionStateSnapshotResponse` has an optional `at`, and `createSessionSSEClient`'s `since` accepts it. It also has an optional `sessionCreatedAt`, and `createSessionSSEClient` takes it as `sessionCreatedAt` and names that session on every connection: once the id holds another session, the server answers 404 and the client stops. `compareItemOrder` breaks a tie on time and index by request id, then item id, where it used to return 0.

  `createSessionSSEClient` takes `onReconnecting`, called before each reconnect with how many tries there have been since the stream last delivered an event: 1 after an ordinary close, 2 or more once a try has failed.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 6b8bfe4: Sessions a dispatcher ran work in are listable on their flow: `GET /sessions` takes `include=dispatch-runs` (off by default), `listSessions` takes `include`, `FlowNavigator` takes `includeDispatchRuns` and draws a run one level under the session that started it, the DevTool shows runs in the rail and inside a session's block tree on demand in place of its Children tab, and `requestHost.livenessOf` now also answers for a dispatch run under the caller's own principal, tenant, organization and flow instance rather than only for one beneath the asking session (FIX-1440).

  The dispatch-run liveness arm compares the caller's organization against the active-request entry as well as the session record. Both comparisons are required: they read separately stamped rows, and a caller whose organization was not forwarded to the read matched only entries carrying no organization at all.

- b48158a: Organization identity is now required on every request (FIX-1442).

  A session, request, dispatched child and scheduled job each carry an
  organization, and the server checks it on reads and execution alongside the
  user. It comes from a configured `resolvePrincipal`, or — when an app
  configures no resolver — from the new reserved `DEFAULT_ORG_ID` exported by
  `@flow-state-dev/core`. A caller-supplied `orgId` is never authoritative.

  **What you need to change**

  - A resolver must return a verified `orgId`. Returning none, a blank one, or
    `DEFAULT_ORG_ID` is refused with 401. A machine transport may return
    `{ orgId }` alone and let `defaultUserId` name its system user.
  - Direct `runAction` calls must pass `orgId` — your verified organization, or
    `DEFAULT_ORG_ID` for single-organization development.
  - `authentication.requireOrg` and a block's `requireOrg` are removed.
    Organization is unconditional, so the declaration had nothing left to say;
    a config that still carries either is rejected at definition time rather
    than ignored.
  - Client and React session APIs no longer take an `orgId` — the server owns
    it. `SessionDetail.orgId` is now required on the way back.
  - `openChannels` no longer takes an `orgId`; the server binds the channel.
  - A queued BullMQ job that carries no organization now fails terminally
    instead of being retried: a worker runs below principal resolution, so no
    later attempt could supply one. Subscribers receive an error terminal rather
    than waiting for a job that never completes.

  **The schedule index stores the organization.** `schedule_index` gains a
  nullable `org_id` column in both the SQLite and PostgreSQL adapters, so the
  organization a schedule fires into survives a round trip through the database.
  The column is added for you on the next schema init — there is no manual DDL
  step. Existing rows read back with no organization and are quarantined rather
  than dispatched, so a schedule written before this upgrade does not fire until
  it is attributed; rewriting it stamps the organization of the execution that
  writes it.

  **Upgrading a store with existing data.** Records written before this carry no
  organization. They are preserved and refused (`409 migration-required`) rather
  than guessed at, and listings and scheduler scans skip them. Attribute them
  offline first — the procedure, including dynamic schedules, index rebuild and
  the reserved-id collision check, is in the persistence guide under "Which
  organization a record belongs to".

### Patch Changes

- 795b550: The debug resource snapshot now reports each resource's `writable` and `llmWritable` settings where they are declared, and the DevTool marks a resource read-only when `writable` is `false` (FIX-1481).
- 4833ff8: `FlowNavigator` browses your flow kinds and their sessions, reading each kind's depth from its declared `cardinality` and fetching sessions only when a leaf opens, and `sessionQueryFor` turns a flow address into the right session-listing filter (FIX-1477).

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- afcac3d: A flow declares its `cardinality` — `"singleton"` (the default: `myFlow()` is the one instance, addressed by its kind, and `myFlow({ id: "default" })` now throws) or `"collection"` (several configured copies, each registered under its own required `id`) — every address (the action, stream, resume, retry and continue routes, `fsdev run`, dispatchers, BullMQ jobs, MCP, webhook and schedule dispatch) is the exact instance id with no first-registered fallback, every session and request records its owning `flowId` and is refused when reached through another instance (`FlowInstanceBindingMismatchError`; `409 wrong-instance-session` / `wrong-instance-request` / `migration-required` on the routes), and SQLite and Postgres add a nullable indexed `flow_id` column with no backfill (FIX-1321, FIX-1322).
- b3e6e22: Initial release (FIX-1187).
- fda9b15: Background work is declared with a task-board dispatcher seat and read back as child sessions: a session's children are listed at `GET /sessions/:sessionId/children` through `listChildSessions()` and `useSession`'s `childSessions` / `childSessionsStale`, session-scoped resources shared with them use `sharedToLineage`, and the two `createFlowState` options are `dispatchDrainTimeoutMs` and `maxChildSessionListLimit`; the Workstream surface they replace is removed, `ctx.requestHost.startDetached` and `dispatch: { mode: "detached" }` with it (FIX-1308). From `@flow-state-dev/orchestration/task-board` that removes the detached-mode helpers (`assertDetachedBoardSupported`, `detachedTaskPredicate`, `coordinateKey`, `coordinateLabel`, `workstreamRoutingSeed`, `WorkerCoordinate`, `TaskWorkerDispatch`, `TaskWorkerSlot`, `TaskWorkerSlotRegistry`, `TaskWorkerEntry`, `isTaskWorkerEntry`) and `board.detachedWorkers`; a seat is a block or a `dispatcher({ type: "task" })`, and `resolveWorkerSlots` now returns the bare blocks plus the `HandOffSeat`s (`name`, `label`, `dispatch`) in one walk from the hand-off module. A `{ worker, dispatch }` or `{ block, session }` seat is refused by name at construction. The DevTool's Children panel pairs a child with its task from the dispatch key a `per-task` or `per-worker` seat derives (a `{ key }` policy pairs nothing) and shows the entry it was dispatched for.

## Pre-1.0 history

Captured from the project's pre-Changesets development log (root `changelog.md`,
deleted on FIX-653). Entries are listed newest-first.

### 2026-05-07 — Lazy collection state, query interface, resource manifest (FIX-427) [BREAKING]

Client surface updated to match the new paginated list, single-item state, and manifest endpoints. Collection snapshots no longer carry an eager `items` map.

### 2026-05-06 — `clientData` privacy fix + rename (FIX-505) [BREAKING]

`FlowClient.state.getSessionState` / `getUserState` / `getOrgState` are removed — they were typed against the privacy-broken response. `getSnapshot` remains; read `clientData.<scope>` from it.

### 2026-04-30 — Connection resilience (FIX-476)

Client SSE parser detects `: ping` comment frames and fires a new `onHeartbeat` callback alongside regular events.

### 2026-04-28 — Interrupted-request recovery

New `createRecoveryClient` with `checkInterrupted` and `retry` methods.

### 2026-04-26 — Org scope rename (FIX-428) [BREAKING]

Client API renamed `project` → `org` across snapshot fields, scope helpers, and recovery routes.
