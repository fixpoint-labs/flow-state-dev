## Pre-1.0 history

Captured from the project's pre-Changesets development log (root `changelog.md`,
deleted on FIX-653). Entries are listed newest-first.

### 2026-05-07 — Lazy collection state, query interface, resource manifest (FIX-427) [BREAKING]

Client surface updated to match the new paginated list, single-item state, and manifest endpoints. Collection snapshots no longer carry an eager `items` map.

### 2026-05-06 — `clientData` privacy fix + rename (FIX-505) [BREAKING]

`FlowClient.state.getSessionState` / `getUserState` / `getOrgState` are removed — they were typed against the privacy-broken response. `getSnapshot` remains; read `clientData.<scope>` from it.

### 2026-04-30 — Connection resilience (FIX-476)

Client SSE parser detects `: ping` comment frames and fires a new `onHeartbeat` callback alongside regular events.

### 2026-04-28 — Interrupted-request recovery

New `createRecoveryClient` with `checkInterrupted` and `retry` methods.

### 2026-04-26 — Org scope rename (FIX-428) [BREAKING]

Client API renamed `project` → `org` across snapshot fields, scope helpers, and recovery routes.
