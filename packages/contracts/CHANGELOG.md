# @flow-state-dev/contracts

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 617aeab: `MANIFEST_DOMAINS` no longer lists `mailboxes` (FIX-1792): discovery's domains are `seats`, `skills` and `resources`.
- 211679a: New core block kind: `evaluator` (FIX-1554). It asks an evaluation model typed questions (`choice`, `score`, `boolean`) and returns typed answers, with the model's confidence when it reports one. Model strings resolve through your existing providers and gateways; models that can only generate are refused before any call. `BlockKind` and the trace's `blockKind` gain `"evaluator"`: code that switches on block kind should handle it. `ai` minimum raised to the first release with evaluation. `@ai-sdk/typesafe-ai` is an optional peer. `ModelResolver` gains an optional `resolveEvaluationModel`; a custom resolver without it runs generators as before and refuses evaluator model strings. Evaluation through Vercel's AI Gateway needs `@ai-sdk/gateway` 4.0.85 or later. `@flow-state-dev/testing` adds `mockEvaluationModel`.
- b808784: Channels are now mailboxes everywhere (`MAILBOX.md` under `teams/<team>/mailboxes/`, the `mailbox` kind, `mailbox-post` items, the `mailboxes` discovery domain, and every export, such as `mailboxFlow`), and the old names are not read, so an old file is reported by name and a store written before this release does not open: start from an empty store (FIX-1748).
- 839e915: A block output or tool result over the new `maxRecordedValueBytes` router option (default 256 KiB) is now recorded as an `omitted` placeholder with its size and a preview while the run keeps the full value, and a resumed request that would need it fails with `RECORDED_VALUE_OMITTED` (FIX-1772).
- d1a4cab: The discovery domain `seats` is `workers`: `discover({ domain: "workers" })` lists what `seats` did, and `seats` is an unknown domain (FIX-1796).
- cd180d7: Stopping a paused request now ends it `aborted` and records its gate with the new `stopped` suspension status, a turn paused on an ask cancels the asked task instead of waiting for it, and a durable host now runs the durability sweeper even without `durabilityRetention`, so a paused request past its `expiresAt` expires and an ask past its deadline times out, while pruning still waits for a retention policy (FIX-1816).

### Patch Changes

- 65ad58a: A resumed request now hands the next step the real result of an earlier `.asTool()` step, because a recorded value that points at a tool result resolves to that result instead of `undefined` (FIX-1847).
- 3b0161c: With a durability provider configured, a request resumed after a stop, or continued through `/continue`, no longer runs its completed steps again when trace observability is off, as it is by default in production. Without a durability provider, `/continue` behaves as it did before: it skips a completed step only from a full trace, so a request recorded with observability off runs again from the top. The lean record is marked `lean: true`. Each completed block now records a lean `block_trace` (its identity and output) whatever the observability setting, and resume replay reads that record to skip the block. Full capture (inputs, generator prompts, resource loads, failed traces) is still gated by `FSDEV_TRACE_OBSERVABILITY`. With observability off, a request's item log now holds one `block_trace` per completed, non-transient block. An output larger than the recorded-value limit is stored as an omitted placeholder, so a resume that reaches that step fails with `RECORDED_VALUE_OMITTED`, naming the block, rather than skipping it or running it again. With a durability provider, crash recovery (`/continue`) is at-least-once for a block whose completion had not been persisted when the process died: that block runs again. A completed `block_trace` now carries `rescued: true` when a `.rescue()` handler produced the block's output, so `ctx.wasRescued()` returns the same answer after a resume (FIX-2137).
- fa7b22e: A tool call that waited on an approval no longer reads as failed. A later turn's history replays it once, with its result; before, it also replayed the wait as a failed call carrying the approval's question, so the model read it as a failure it had retried. `isSuspensionWait(item)` (from `@flow-state-dev/contracts/items`, re-exported by `@flow-state-dev/core/items`) tells such a wait from a real failure, and the registry's tool card draws it as awaiting approval. Shift Manager draws a waiting call as waiting, and a conversation redraws once its ask is answered on the page, again when the run it resumed stops (FIX-1901).
- 60c8192: `getItems()`, `RequestRecord.items` and item subscriptions return `RuntimeItem`, which is `OutputItem` plus trace rows: `block_trace`, `router_decision`, `state_snapshot` and `generator_step` (FIX-2054). Only types change. Runtime behaviour is the same.

  These signatures return or pass `RuntimeItem`, which can break code that expects `OutputItem`:

  - `ResponseEmitterHandle.getItems()` and the `subscribeToItems` listener and filter (core).
  - `ResponseEmitter.getItems()`, `RequestRecord.items` and `RequestStore.persistItems` (engine).
  - The `testItems` selectors that don't filter by type: `all()`, `sideChain()`, `main()`, `byAgent()` and `byVisibility()` (testing). They return trace rows when given them.

  To upgrade, type arrays and callbacks that receive these values as `RuntimeItem`, imported from `@flow-state-dev/core`. Where code needs an `OutputItem`, filter out the trace rows with a type guard:

  ```ts
  import type { RuntimeItem } from "@flow-state-dev/core";
  import type { OutputItem } from "@flow-state-dev/core/items";

  const TRACE = new Set([
    "block_trace",
    "router_decision",
    "state_snapshot",
    "generator_step",
  ]);
  const isOutputItem = (item: RuntimeItem): item is OutputItem =>
    !TRACE.has(item.type);

  const visible = emitter.getItems().filter(isOutputItem);
  ```

  `.waitForCondition` predicates and `wakeOn` filters keep their `OutputItem` types. These signatures accept `RuntimeItem` as well as `OutputItem`: `resolveItemVisibility` and `collapseToCanonicalLog` (contracts, re-exported by core), `testItems` (testing), and the filter that `onTaskChangeFor` returns (orchestration). Existing callers need no change.

  `RequestStreamStore` and `createRequestStreamStore` (client) take the row type as a parameter, defaulting to `OutputItem`, so existing stores are unchanged. A store seeded with trace rows is created as `createRequestStreamStore<RuntimeItem>()`, and its `getSorted()`, `getRaw()`, `getById()` and `getOwnedBy()` return `RuntimeItem`.

- b7c523b: Add the session stream's event types: `SessionItemEvent`, `SessionRunsChangedEvent`, `SessionPingEvent`, their union `SessionStreamEvent`, and `SessionRun` (FIX-1609).

  Add `compareItemOrder`, the one order items are shown in: `ts`, then `itemIndex`, then `requestId`, then `id`. The session snapshot and a client merging streamed items both sort with it.

- a021cd1: `@flow-state-dev/contracts/helpers` (and `@flow-state-dev/core/helpers`) now export the resource-state version rule every `ResourceStateStore` adapter uses: `assertSetExpectedVersion`, `assertDeleteExpectedVersion` and `resourceStateConflict`, with the `ExpectedVersion`, `VersionedRow` and `VersionConflict` types. A custom store adapter can import them instead of copying the rule. `cloneValue` is now also exported from `@flow-state-dev/contracts/helpers`; its `@flow-state-dev/core/helpers` export is unchanged. No store's behaviour changes (FIX-1277).
- e11764a: `ctx.suspend()` takes an optional `title`, a short heading for the ask, carried onto the suspension record and the `suspension` item; `message` is then the body under it. The Error Reporter's preview now sends a short title with its count and questions as a markdown body (FIX-2030).
- 84cc226: New `isWindowsReservedName(name)` helper on `@flow-state-dev/contracts/helpers`, re-exported from `@flow-state-dev/core/helpers`: `true` for the names Windows reserves for devices (`con`, `prn`, `aux`, `nul`, `com1`–`com9`, `lpt1`–`lpt9`) in any letter case. The filesystem store and the workforce tree loader now both read this one list; which names they refuse, and the messages they give, are unchanged (FIX-1428).

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- b597600: An agent can now ask what it can work with: `discoveryTools(createManifestRegistry([...]))` returns one `discover` tool that answers from whatever domains a scope registers a source for, and `resourcesManifestSource()` ships the resources domain. Two enumerators that ignored the `llmReadable` gate are closed with it — `resourceTools().listResources` is **removed** (it had no caller), and `globResources` now lists only resources the agent may read (FIX-817).
- e4c443e: A task board now reports when it saves a task's result and then cannot announce
  it, instead of finishing the run as though nothing went wrong. The failure lands
  on a persisted `task-board-recorder-failure` item and fails the run once every
  other task has drained; on a handed-off task it fails that child run. `onError`
  does not suppress it. Where the board cannot tell whether the write landed —
  permanently so on a task store you supplied, and on rows that predate write
  provenance — it says `undetermined` rather than assuming the write was lost, and
  hands the row back rather than leaving it claimed. `createRecordSuccess` and
  `createRecordError` composed outside a board raise the failure where it happens,
  since nothing downstream would read the report (FIX-963).

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- b56e7d1: Every package can be imported again: 0.1.1 shipped JavaScript whose relative imports were missing the file extensions Node's ESM resolver requires, so importing any 0.1.1 package failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` (FIX-1431).

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- b3e6e22: Initial release (FIX-1187).

## 0.0.0

- Initial release. Extracts the item taxonomy, the deterministic
  block-instance-id helpers, and the pure leaf types (`ModelIdentity`,
  `SuspensionReason`, `SuspensionStatus`, `RequestStatus`) out of
  `@flow-state-dev/core` into a zero-dependency shared layer. `core`
  re-exports every moved symbol from its original path, so the move is
  non-breaking for existing consumers.
