# @flow-state-dev/devtool

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- b3e6e22: Initial release (FIX-1187).
- fda9b15: Background work is declared with a task-board dispatcher seat and read back as child sessions: a session's children are listed at `GET /sessions/:sessionId/children` through `listChildSessions()` and `useSession`'s `childSessions` / `childSessionsStale`, session-scoped resources shared with them use `sharedToLineage`, and the two `createFlowState` options are `dispatchDrainTimeoutMs` and `maxChildSessionListLimit`; the Workstream surface they replace is removed, `ctx.requestHost.startDetached` and `dispatch: { mode: "detached" }` with it (FIX-1308). From `@flow-state-dev/orchestration/task-board` that removes the detached-mode helpers (`assertDetachedBoardSupported`, `detachedTaskPredicate`, `coordinateKey`, `coordinateLabel`, `workstreamRoutingSeed`, `WorkerCoordinate`, `TaskWorkerDispatch`, `TaskWorkerSlot`, `TaskWorkerSlotRegistry`, `TaskWorkerEntry`, `isTaskWorkerEntry`) and `board.detachedWorkers`; a seat is a block or a `dispatcher({ type: "task" })`, and `resolveWorkerSlots` now returns the bare blocks plus the `HandOffSeat`s (`name`, `label`, `dispatch`) in one walk from the hand-off module. A `{ worker, dispatch }` or `{ block, session }` seat is refused by name at construction. The DevTool's Children panel pairs a child with its task from the dispatch key a `per-task` or `per-worker` seat derives (a `{ key }` policy pairs nothing) and shows the entry it was dispatched for.

### Patch Changes

- 229da65: Task status `awaiting_review` is now `parked` (FIX-1245).

  `parked` is the word the docs and the task board already use for a task waiting on a
  person, and it is now the value on the wire too. `TaskStatus`, the transition table, and
  every board and skill surface that names the status use it.

  Rows persisted under the old name keep working. A stored task still carrying
  `awaiting_review` reads back as `parked` on both paths a row can arrive by: through
  `taskSchema` where state is parsed, and at the collection read boundary where a task row
  is cast rather than parsed — which is the path the task board itself runs on. Nothing to
  migrate, and no dual-write window: new writes always store `parked`, and the first write
  to a legacy row heals it.

  **What to change in your code:** anything comparing a task's status to the string
  `awaiting_review`, or listing it in a status filter, should now use `parked`. The
  `awaitReview()` method that parks a task is unchanged.

  **Replaying an old trace still works.** `task-change` items and `task-board-meta` counts
  already written into a persisted item log keep the old status word — an item log is
  immutable, so nothing can rewrite them. The DevTool and the task-plan renderer map them
  forward as they fold the log, so an old parked row renders as parked and its count reaches
  the ribbon.

### 2026-04-11 — DevTool: `fsdev dev` + `@flow-state-dev/devtool` (FIX-261)

New package. Ships pre-built DevTool static assets and exports `getAssetPath()` so the CLI's `fsdev dev` command can serve them from a single port. The build pipeline builds the DevTool Vite app (`apps/devtool`) and copies the output into this package. The CLI lists `@flow-state-dev/devtool` as an optional peer dependency.
