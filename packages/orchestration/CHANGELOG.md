# @flow-state-dev/orchestration

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 0f812c9: Skills, seats and channels now answer the agent discovery door and a seat narrows what it sees with its worker file's `discover:` key (FIX-817) — **breaking:** `createWorkforceCapability` no longer accepts `agents` (pass `roster` and `inventory`) or `catalog` (pass it to `defineAgentWorkerFlow({ catalog })` instead), each now a type error naming its replacement.
- e4c443e: A task board now reports when it saves a task's result and then cannot announce
  it, instead of finishing the run as though nothing went wrong. The failure lands
  on a persisted `task-board-recorder-failure` item and fails the run once every
  other task has drained; on a handed-off task it fails that child run. `onError`
  does not suppress it. Where the board cannot tell whether the write landed —
  permanently so on a task store you supplied, and on rows that predate write
  provenance — it says `undetermined` rather than assuming the write was lost, and
  hands the row back rather than leaving it claimed. `createRecordSuccess` and
  `createRecordError` composed outside a board raise the failure where it happens,
  since nothing downstream would read the report (FIX-963).
- bff5e06: FIX-1393: a generator's declared `tools:` is now a runtime fence over capability-contributed tools, not just a documented one.

  A capability's tools used to be unioned onto whatever the block declared, so a block with `tools: []` could still be handed tools it never named. Declaring the slot now drops a capability's catalog-granted tools — `tools: []` reaches the model with none. Omitting `tools:` entirely is unchanged: it declares no fence, so capability tools still flow.

  Capabilities declare tools through two slots. `tools` is a grant from the app's catalog and is fenced. The new `controlTools` is a framework control the consuming block's own configuration asked for, and the fence never touches it — a control is built inside its capability and never exported, so no `tools:` list could name it back in. One capability may use both: the skills library registers the app catalog through `tools` and its own skill loader through `controlTools`, and `taskTools` contributes the delegation board entirely as controls.

  **Migration.** If you relied on a capability's tools arriving past a narrower `tools:` declaration, name them in `tools:` or drop the declaration. Pattern factories (`planAndExecute`, `supervisor`, `routedSpecialists`) forward both slots, so a call site passing `tools` and `uses` together now gets the fence inside the pattern. Capability authors whose tools are framework controls rather than catalog grants should move them to `controlTools`.

### Patch Changes

- 8faf08e: A `CHANNEL.md` can declare `boards:`, durable task ledgers the channel holds, with `fileTask` and `readBoard` actions on the channel and a `channelBoard()` helper for the worker that drains them (FIX-1385).
- 218de72: An active skill's `allowed-tools` now renders into the generator's context as the skill's intent rather than as a grant of tool access (FIX-1451).

### Patch Changes

- b56e7d1: Every package can be imported again: 0.1.1 shipped JavaScript whose relative imports were missing the file extensions Node's ESM resolver requires, so importing any 0.1.1 package failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` (FIX-1431).

  - @flow-state-dev/core@0.1.2

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 64b323e: A skill `agents:` `prompt-ref` entry is the seat name only — `tools`, `model`, `visibility`, and `context-supply` now live in the prompt file's YAML frontmatter, and leftover skill-entry tuning is rejected at parse (FIX-1370).
- c25ad3e: `createSkillActivator` takes a new `enableKeywordMatch` option (default `true`, preserving today's pipeline). Set it `false` to drop tier 2 (keyword scan) from the activator pipeline entirely, leaving only the slash tier and, if enabled, the classifier — useful for a caller whose activation contract has no keyword tier (FIX-1363).
- 23ac6de: `createSkillsLibrary({ catalog })` takes a new `registerCatalogTools` option (default `true`, preserving today's behaviour). Set it `false` to keep validating a bound skill's declared `allowed-tools` against `catalog` without the library registering any of `catalog` on the generator itself — useful when a caller already owns tool registration through its own means (FIX-1363).

### Patch Changes

- 23bc757: Each worker on a roster now holds its own skills, seeded from its own org, team and worker folders instead of one shared bucket — a catalog already seeded under the shared key is re-seeded under the worker's own and its old rows are left behind (FIX-1362).
- 119936d: New `@flow-state-dev/workforce/loader` subpath: `readWorkforceDirectory(root)` scans `teams/<id>/workers/<name>/` and returns one neutral manifest per worker, so a workforce can be declared in files instead of wired by hand (FIX-1335). `orchestration` gains `splitFrontmatter` and `parseFrontmatterYaml`, the frontmatter dialect `SKILL.md` and `WORKER.md` share; parsed frontmatter records now have no prototype, so a `__proto__:` key in a hand-written file is carried as an ordinary key instead of silently replacing the record's prototype.
- 8a1173a: `readSkillsDirectory` now reports a `SKILL.md` that exists and cannot be read as a read failure, with the underlying reason, instead of reporting it as missing. A genuinely absent `SKILL.md` still reports missing (FIX-1356).

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- bea3a24: `resumeFromReview` is renamed `unpark` and now refuses every status but `parked` as a `declined` value instead of writing or throwing, and the task board gains `board.unparkAndDrain`, a step that writes an answer to a parked task and drains the board in the same request only when the answer was accepted (FIX-1244).
- b3e6e22: Initial release (FIX-1187).
- 5fa52aa: One dispatch protocol: every arrival at a flow — a caller's action, a webhook, a schedule, a task hand-off, an internal dispatch — is a dispatch of one type delivered to one entry addressed by `(type, name)`, with no fallback between types (FIX-1302).

  - **`defineFlow` gains `internal` and `task` entries, nested under their type.** `internal: { actions: { wake: { block } } }` and `task: { actions: { implement: { block } } }` are declared like actions and are definition-only, like the transport maps; the flat `internal: { wake }` / `tasks: { implement }` spelling is refused by name. An `internal` entry is reachable only from a `dispatcher()` inside the flow; a `task` entry is reachable only from a `dispatcher({ type: "task" })` seat on a task board the flow reaches, and `defineFlow` puts each one behind that board's claim gate (the row re-read, the claim verified, the task scope marked, the ticket re-minted) before the block runs. A task entry no board addresses, a task dispatcher no board holds, and two boards addressing one entry are refused at definition. Every entry, of every type, accepts its own `concurrency` (`ActionCore.concurrency`).
  - **`dispatcher()` is the block that sends.** `dispatcher({ name, type: "internal", target, session: { key } | { id }, payload? })` (`InternalDispatcherConfig`) returns a handler carrying its static address, and `defineFlow` refuses an address the flow does not declare — through composition, rescue handlers, and a generator's static `tools`. `{ key }` derives a child session of the running one (minted, then adopted on the same key); `{ id }` delivers into an existing session of the same flow and principal, refuses an unknown id rather than creating one, and is dropped if that session was deleted and recreated between acceptance and the run. A refusal throws `DispatchRefusedError` naming the refusal (`no-entry`, `session-not-found`, `session-not-addressable`, `key-occupied`, `no-dispatch-operation`, `dispatch-rejected`, `external-dispatcher`).
  - **`.forEach()` and `.forEachSideChain()` accept `blocks`.** A per-item factory declares the blocks it can produce, so they are walked for dispatch addresses and merged for resources like a block-shaped call's element. A task board's drain uses it, which is what lets `defineFlow` refuse a flow that reaches a board with a hand-off seat but never declares the entry it addresses.
  - **A task board hands off through a dispatcher seat.** A seat under `workers` is a block; a `dispatcher({ name, type: "task", target, session: "per-task" | "per-worker" | { key: (task) => string } })` (`TaskDispatcherConfig`) in that position hands the seat's rows off to `flow.task.actions[target]` in the child session the policy names. A `task` dispatch carries `{ boardId, seat, taskId, attempt, createdAt, incarnationId?, payload }` (`taskDispatchInputSchema`, `TaskDispatchInput` from core), and the entry's gate re-reads the row and verifies the claim before the block runs. A refused hand-off throws the same `DispatchRefusedError` a `dispatcher()` block throws. An entry a `per-worker` or `key` seat hands off to defaults to `concurrency: "queue"` (an explicit policy wins); a `per-task` seat keeps the flow default. `board.handedOff` lists the seats that hand off; `createTaskGate`, `createHandOff`, `StaleTaskClaimError` and the `TaskSeatRegistry` type are exported from `@flow-state-dev/orchestration/task-board`. `TaskSessionPolicy`, `taskSessionKeyFor`, `bindTaskDispatcher` and `taskBindingOf` are exported from core for substrate code.
  - **A dispatched request is stamped.** It records `metadata.dispatch = { type, target, from, key?, ... }` under `source: "internal"` or `"task"`; the child session it runs in carries `topic` (the key) and `coordinate` (`"<type>:<target>"`) and is listed by `GET /sessions/:sessionId/children` like any other child of its parent.
  - **`task` and `internal` dispatches can never be re-entered** from a public route: retry, continue and resume refuse them, and `publicReentrySources` cannot re-open them.
  - **`createMockTransportHost` publishes `usesExternalDispatcher: false`**, matching the widened `InboundTransportHost` contract.
  - **The dispatch seam is not a named member of the block context** — reach it with `dispatcher()`, or in substrate code with `dispatchThroughSeam` and `markDispatcher`. The Workstream surface this protocol replaces is removed in the same release; see the Workstream-removal note for the renames.

- 229da65: Task status `awaiting_review` is now `parked` (FIX-1245).

  `parked` is the word the docs and the task board already use for a task waiting on a
  person, and it is now the value on the wire too. `TaskStatus`, the transition table, and
  every board and skill surface that names the status use it.

  Rows persisted under the old name keep working. A stored task still carrying
  `awaiting_review` reads back as `parked` on both paths a row can arrive by: through
  `taskSchema` where state is parsed, and at the collection read boundary where a task row
  is cast rather than parsed — which is the path the task board itself runs on. Nothing to
  migrate, and no dual-write window: new writes always store `parked`, and the first write
  to a legacy row heals it.

  **What to change in your code:** anything comparing a task's status to the string
  `awaiting_review`, or listing it in a status filter, should now use `parked`. The
  `awaitReview()` method that parks a task is unchanged.

  **Replaying an old trace still works.** `task-change` items and `task-board-meta` counts
  already written into a persisted item log keep the old status word — an item log is
  immutable, so nothing can rewrite them. The DevTool and the task-plan renderer map them
  forward as they fold the log, so an old parked row renders as parked and its count reaches
  the ribbon.

- 2c4b0f5: Skills now follow the Agent Skills specification (https://agentskills.io/specification)
  in full for a SKILL.md's frontmatter (FIX-1318).

  - `name`, `license`, `compatibility`, and `metadata` are parsed into typed fields
    on `SkillState` (and `Skill`) instead of being kept only as preserved unknown
    keys. `name` is validated and must match the folder it lives in;
    `compatibility` is capped at 500 characters; `metadata` is a string → string
    map. `MAX_COMPATIBILITY_LENGTH` is exported alongside the existing caps.
  - `parseSkillMd` takes an optional `{ expectedName }` so directory readers and
    seeders can enforce the name/folder match. `readSkillsDirectory`,
    `importSkillsDirectory`, `ensureSeeded`, and `createSkillsLibrary` pass it.
  - Skill names follow the spec's hyphen rules: no leading, trailing, or
    consecutive hyphens. Names like `pdf-` or `pdf--tools` were accepted before
    and are rejected now.
  - `allowed-tools` accepts the spec's space-separated string form
    (`allowed-tools: search fetch`) in addition to a YAML list, and
    `serializeSkillMd` writes it in the spec form.

- fda9b15: Background work is declared with a task-board dispatcher seat and read back as child sessions: a session's children are listed at `GET /sessions/:sessionId/children` through `listChildSessions()` and `useSession`'s `childSessions` / `childSessionsStale`, session-scoped resources shared with them use `sharedToLineage`, and the two `createFlowState` options are `dispatchDrainTimeoutMs` and `maxChildSessionListLimit`; the Workstream surface they replace is removed, `ctx.requestHost.startDetached` and `dispatch: { mode: "detached" }` with it (FIX-1308). From `@flow-state-dev/orchestration/task-board` that removes the detached-mode helpers (`assertDetachedBoardSupported`, `detachedTaskPredicate`, `coordinateKey`, `coordinateLabel`, `workstreamRoutingSeed`, `WorkerCoordinate`, `TaskWorkerDispatch`, `TaskWorkerSlot`, `TaskWorkerSlotRegistry`, `TaskWorkerEntry`, `isTaskWorkerEntry`) and `board.detachedWorkers`; a seat is a block or a `dispatcher({ type: "task" })`, and `resolveWorkerSlots` now returns the bare blocks plus the `HandOffSeat`s (`name`, `label`, `dispatch`) in one walk from the hand-off module. A `{ worker, dispatch }` or `{ block, session }` seat is refused by name at construction. The DevTool's Children panel pairs a child with its task from the dispatch key a `per-task` or `per-worker` seat derives (a `{ key }` policy pairs nothing) and shows the entry it was dispatched for.

### Patch Changes

- b484d86: Task Board workers that declare `taskWorkerInputSchema` now receive the `priorWork` the board's flow policy selected instead of having it stripped by the schema (FIX-1288).
- 0443742: A task handed to a child session now takes its row back and runs when the child starts after the lease has lapsed, instead of refusing the dispatch and waiting for another drain to spend an attempt re-dispatching it (FIX-1305) — `renewLease` gains `adoptLapsedLease` for that takeover, tasks record the lease duration their claim was granted as `leaseDurationMs`, and `committedLeaseSpan(task)` reads it back.

## Pre-1.0 history

Captured from the project's pre-Changesets development log (root `changelog.md`,
deleted on FIX-653). Entries are listed newest-first.

### 2026-05-13 — Skills declare a pattern (FIX-450)

New `taskTools` capability exposes `addTask`, `assignTask`, `completeTask`, `failTask`, `blockTask`, `cancelTask`, `updateTask`, `listTasks` for runtime mutation of the active pattern's board. Composes by default when `patternRegistry` is wired; opt out with `taskTools: false`. With no active pattern each tool returns a structured `no_active_pattern` error.

### 2026-04-30 — SSE noise reduction (FIX-477)

`taskBoard` worker schemas now mark `lastClaimed` and `currentTaskId` as `transientSlot` so claim-loop bookkeeping never appears on the wire or in checkpoints.

### 2026-04-30 — Sub-agent items as first-class data (FIX-480)

`TaskCollectionRef.list` / `get` now return a `TaskHandle` — the existing `Task` data fields plus an `items()` accessor returning the items emitted during the worker's claim window. Substrate utilities `extractTaskItems(items, collectionId, taskId)` and `computeTaskItemWindows(items, collectionId)` are exported.

### 2026-04-30 — `taskBoard` follow-up (FIX-447)

`TaskWorkerInput.deps` is now substrate-supplied. The worker dispatch path resolves each `task.deps[]` entry to its dep's `output` and passes the map to the worker before invocation. Substrate-internal task-board blocks (`claimTask`, `checkBoard`, `recordSuccess`, `recordError`, `seedCollection`, board-meta emitters) marked `transient: true`. `claimTask` skips its `lastClaimed` state patch when the value is unchanged. `claimTask` emits `Working on: {task.goal}` status on each successful claim.

### 2026-04-29 — Patterns migrated onto `taskBoard` (FIX-447)

Substrate emits `task-change` (per-task lifecycle) and `task-board-meta` (board-level aggregate) items.

### 2026-04-29 — `@flow-state-dev/tasks` substrate (FIX-444)

New package. Ships the unified Plan/Task primitive substrate. Canonical `Task` shape with status enum `pending | in_progress | blocked | awaiting_review | completed | errored | cancelled` and a `TaskCollectionRef` API across two backings: `sequencer` (default, durable) and `resource` (for collections that outlive a request). Five standard dispatchers, a `TaskWorkerInput` worker contract, `task_change` item emissions, helpers (`taskLoopBack`, `dispatchAndExecute`). HITL-ready (review lifecycle, `awaitReview` / `resumeFromReview`).
