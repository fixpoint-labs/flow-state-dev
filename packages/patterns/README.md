# @flow-state-dev/patterns

Reference implementations of established AI composition patterns using the @flow-state-dev framework.

Each pattern validates that the framework's block composition model handles a specific class of AI architecture cleanly, and serves as a reusable building block for consumer flows.

## Patterns

### RLM (Recursive Language Model)

Implements the Recursive Language Model architecture ([Gao et al. 2025](https://alexzhang13.github.io/blog/2025/rlm/)). An LM that never sees the full context directly — instead using tools to explore, search, and recursively sub-query over large contexts.

**What it validates:**
- Generator-as-tool composition (generator listed in another generator's `tools` array)
- Handler blocks as LLM-callable tools (peek, grep, chunk)
- Session resources for large context storage
- Depth control via tool set restriction (leaf generators omit the recursive tool)

**Zero framework changes required.**

```typescript
import { rlmPipeline, rlmQueryInputSchema, contextResourceStateSchema } from "@flow-state-dev/patterns";

// Wire into your flow as an action
const myFlow = defineFlow({
  actions: {
    rlm: {
      inputSchema: rlmQueryInputSchema,
      block: rlmPipeline
    }
  },
  session: {
    resources: {
      context: { stateSchema: contextResourceStateSchema, writable: true }
    }
  }
});
```

See `examples/kitchen-sink` for a full integration example.
