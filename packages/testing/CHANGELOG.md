# @flow-state-dev/testing

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- b3e6e22: Initial release (FIX-1187).

### Patch Changes

- 5fa52aa: One dispatch protocol: every arrival at a flow — a caller's action, a chat event, a webhook, a schedule, a task hand-off, an internal dispatch — is a dispatch of one type delivered to one entry addressed by `(type, name)`, with no fallback between types (FIX-1302).

  - **`defineFlow` gains `internal` and `task` entries, nested under their type.** `internal: { actions: { wake: { block } } }` and `task: { actions: { implement: { block } } }` are declared like actions and are definition-only, like the transport maps; the flat `internal: { wake }` / `tasks: { implement }` spelling is refused by name. An `internal` entry is reachable only from a `dispatcher()` inside the flow; a `task` entry is reachable only from a `dispatcher({ type: "task" })` seat on a task board the flow reaches, and `defineFlow` puts each one behind that board's claim gate (the row re-read, the claim verified, the task scope marked, the ticket re-minted) before the block runs. A task entry no board addresses, a task dispatcher no board holds, and two boards addressing one entry are refused at definition. Every entry, of every type, accepts its own `concurrency` (`ActionCore.concurrency`).
  - **`dispatcher()` is the block that sends.** `dispatcher({ name, type: "internal", target, session: { key } | { id }, payload? })` (`InternalDispatcherConfig`) returns a handler carrying its static address, and `defineFlow` refuses an address the flow does not declare — through composition, rescue handlers, and a generator's static `tools`. `{ key }` derives a child session of the running one (minted, then adopted on the same key); `{ id }` delivers into an existing session of the same flow and principal, refuses an unknown id rather than creating one, and is dropped if that session was deleted and recreated between acceptance and the run. A refusal throws `DispatchRefusedError` naming the refusal (`no-entry`, `session-not-found`, `session-not-addressable`, `key-occupied`, `no-dispatch-operation`, `dispatch-rejected`, `external-dispatcher`).
  - **`.forEach()` and `.forEachSideChain()` accept `blocks`.** A per-item factory declares the blocks it can produce, so they are walked for dispatch addresses and merged for resources like a block-shaped call's element. A task board's drain uses it, which is what lets `defineFlow` refuse a flow that reaches a board with a hand-off seat but never declares the entry it addresses.
  - **A task board hands off through a dispatcher seat.** A seat under `workers` is a block; a `dispatcher({ name, type: "task", target, session: "per-task" | "per-worker" | { key: (task) => string } })` (`TaskDispatcherConfig`) in that position hands the seat's rows off to `flow.task.actions[target]` in the child session the policy names. A `task` dispatch carries `{ boardId, seat, taskId, attempt, createdAt, incarnationId?, payload }` (`taskDispatchInputSchema`, `TaskDispatchInput` from core), and the entry's gate re-reads the row and verifies the claim before the block runs. A refused hand-off throws the same `DispatchRefusedError` a `dispatcher()` block throws. An entry a `per-worker` or `key` seat hands off to defaults to `concurrency: "queue"` (an explicit policy wins); a `per-task` seat keeps the flow default. `board.handedOff` lists the seats that hand off; `createTaskGate`, `createHandOff`, `StaleTaskClaimError` and the `TaskSeatRegistry` type are exported from `@flow-state-dev/orchestration/task-board`. `TaskSessionPolicy`, `taskSessionKeyFor`, `bindTaskDispatcher` and `taskBindingOf` are exported from core for substrate code.
  - **A dispatched request is stamped.** It records `metadata.dispatch = { type, target, from, key?, ... }` under `source: "internal"` or `"task"`; the child session it runs in carries `topic` (the key) and `coordinate` (`"<type>:<target>"`) and is listed by `GET /sessions/:sessionId/children` like any other child of its parent.
  - **`task` and `internal` dispatches can never be re-entered** from a public route: retry, continue and resume refuse them, and `publicReentrySources` cannot re-open them.
  - **`createMockTransportHost` publishes `usesExternalDispatcher: false`**, matching the widened `InboundTransportHost` contract.
  - **The dispatch seam is not a named member of the block context** — reach it with `dispatcher()`, or in substrate code with `dispatchThroughSeam` and `markDispatcher`. The Workstream surface this protocol replaces is removed in the same release; see the Workstream-removal note for the renames.

## Pre-1.0 history

Captured from the project's pre-Changesets development log (root `changelog.md`,
deleted on FIX-653). Entries are listed newest-first.

### 2026-05-01 — Tier 1 flow integration test suite (FIX-487)

`mockGenerator` accepts `{ when, then }` predicate entries alongside plain steps. Predicates match by input and stay matchable on every call. `mockGenerator` now simulates the AI SDK's internal multi-step tool loop. `testFlow` accepts an optional `stores: StoreRegistry`; multiple runs sharing the same registry preserve session, journal, and resource state across calls.

### 2026-05-01 — `fsdev run` as primary CLI dev loop (FIX-490)

`@flow-state-dev/testing` no longer re-exports `createInboundTransportConformanceTests` and `createMockTransportHost` from its index — they imported `vitest` at module top level, breaking non-test consumers. Available via the new `@flow-state-dev/testing/conformance` subpath export.

### 2026-04-29 — Inbound transport adapter contract (FIX-438)

Conformance suite for `InboundTransportAdapter` implementations ships in `@flow-state-dev/testing` so future MCP / webhook / scheduled adapters plug into the same harness.

### 2026-04-26 — Org scope rename (FIX-428) [BREAKING]

Test harness seeding renamed `project` → `org`.

### 2026-02-15 — Initial scaffolding

Initial scaffolding: `testBlock`, `testSequencer`, `testRouter`, `testFlow`, `testItems`, `snapshotTrace`, `mockGenerator`. `createMockModelResolver` migrated mocks to the model boundary.
