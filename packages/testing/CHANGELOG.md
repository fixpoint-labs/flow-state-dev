# @flow-state-dev/testing

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 2ffc03c: "Dispatcher" now names only the `dispatcher()` block (FIX-2245). Two other things that shared the word are renamed, with no alias.

  - A task board's rule for which ready task it claims next is a claim order. `TaskDispatcher` is `ClaimOrder`; `fifoDispatcher`, `topologicalDispatcher` and `priorityDispatcher` are `fifoClaimOrder`, `topologicalClaimOrder` and `priorityClaimOrder`; harness-manager's `runOwnerDispatcher()` is `runOwnerClaimOrder()`. The task board's option is `claimOrder` (it was `dispatcher`, which it now refuses by name), and takes the same `"fifo"`, `"topological"` and `"priority"` names.
  - What decides where a flow action runs is a runner. `FlowDispatcher` is `FlowRunner`, `InProcessDispatcher` and `InProcessDispatcherDeps` are `InProcessRunner` and `InProcessRunnerDeps`, `createInProcessDispatcher` and `isInProcessDispatcher` are `createInProcessRunner` and `isInProcessRunner`, and BullMQ's `createWorkerDispatcher` and `CreateWorkerDispatcherOptions` are `createWorkerRunner` and `CreateWorkerRunnerOptions`. The option on `createFlowState`, `createFlowApiRouter` and `createInboundTransportHost` is `runner` (it was `dispatcher`, which they now refuse by name), `WorkerAdapter.createDispatcher` is `createRunner`, and `InboundTransportHost.usesExternalDispatcher` is `usesExternalRunner`.

  The `external-dispatcher` refusal keeps its value.

- 211679a: New core block kind: `evaluator` (FIX-1554). It asks an evaluation model typed questions (`choice`, `score`, `boolean`) and returns typed answers, with the model's confidence when it reports one. Model strings resolve through your existing providers and gateways; models that can only generate are refused before any call. `BlockKind` and the trace's `blockKind` gain `"evaluator"`: code that switches on block kind should handle it. `ai` minimum raised to the first release with evaluation. `@ai-sdk/typesafe-ai` is an optional peer. `ModelResolver` gains an optional `resolveEvaluationModel`; a custom resolver without it runs generators as before and refuses evaluator model strings. Evaluation through Vercel's AI Gateway needs `@ai-sdk/gateway` 4.0.85 or later. `@flow-state-dev/testing` adds `mockEvaluationModel`.
- 60c8192: `getItems()`, `RequestRecord.items` and item subscriptions return `RuntimeItem`, which is `OutputItem` plus trace rows: `block_trace`, `router_decision`, `state_snapshot` and `generator_step` (FIX-2054). Only types change. Runtime behaviour is the same.

  These signatures return or pass `RuntimeItem`, which can break code that expects `OutputItem`:

  - `ResponseEmitterHandle.getItems()` and the `subscribeToItems` listener and filter (core).
  - `ResponseEmitter.getItems()`, `RequestRecord.items` and `RequestStore.persistItems` (engine).
  - The `testItems` selectors that don't filter by type: `all()`, `sideChain()`, `main()`, `byAgent()` and `byVisibility()` (testing). They return trace rows when given them.

  To upgrade, type arrays and callbacks that receive these values as `RuntimeItem`, imported from `@flow-state-dev/core`. Where code needs an `OutputItem`, filter out the trace rows with a type guard:

  ```ts
  import type { RuntimeItem } from "@flow-state-dev/core";
  import type { OutputItem } from "@flow-state-dev/core/items";

  const TRACE = new Set([
    "block_trace",
    "router_decision",
    "state_snapshot",
    "generator_step",
  ]);
  const isOutputItem = (item: RuntimeItem): item is OutputItem =>
    !TRACE.has(item.type);

  const visible = emitter.getItems().filter(isOutputItem);
  ```

  `.waitForCondition` predicates and `wakeOn` filters keep their `OutputItem` types. These signatures accept `RuntimeItem` as well as `OutputItem`: `resolveItemVisibility` and `collapseToCanonicalLog` (contracts, re-exported by core), `testItems` (testing), and the filter that `onTaskChangeFor` returns (orchestration). Existing callers need no change.

  `RequestStreamStore` and `createRequestStreamStore` (client) take the row type as a parameter, defaulting to `OutputItem`, so existing stores are unchanged. A store seeded with trace rows is created as `createRequestStreamStore<RuntimeItem>()`, and its `getSorted()`, `getRaw()`, `getById()` and `getOwnedBy()` return `RuntimeItem`.

- 69ba29c: Every flow now keeps a user's data per organization, so `resolveUserStorageKey(userId, orgId, flow)` takes the organization and throws without one, a dynamic schedule's dispatch id is `<orgId>/<userId>/<key>` (built by the new `formatScheduleId`), and the test harness seeds user data in the run's organization (FIX-1790).

### Patch Changes

- dd80e01: Evaluators work with `@ai-sdk/gateway` 4.0.108 and later: core now requires `ai` 7.0.133 or later, which sends an evaluator's state the way those versions read it, and an array state still reaches the model as the array it is. Evaluation through Vercel's AI Gateway now needs `@ai-sdk/gateway` 4.0.108 or later in your app. `mockEvaluationModel` hands its `answers` function, and records on `calls`, the state the evaluator evaluated (FIX-1925).
- b2d2679: A hand-written `MockGeneratorInstance`'s `next()` now receives `{ toolResults }` as a second argument, what the tools the current call already ran returned, so a scripted step can depend on a tool's result (FIX-1589).
- bb16f3a: `createMockModelResolver` takes `evaluators`, keyed by block name, so an evaluator with a model string resolves to a scripted evaluation, and `mockEvaluationModel`'s `answers` can be a function of each call's state (FIX-1610).
- 849f6ec: Built-in model defaults move to the current generation (FIX-2050). `utility.sessionTitleGenerator`, `utility.decomposer`, the `planAndExecute` / `routedSpecialists` pattern defaults and `workingMemoryObserve` now default to `gpt-6-luna`, as do Shift Manager's Lab default model (`LAB_DEFAULT_MODEL`) and its DevTeam workers (previously `gpt-5-nano`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5-mini` or `gpt-4o-mini`). Pass `model` explicitly to keep the old one. The cost tables in `core` and `testing` now price `gpt-6-astra`, `gpt-6.1-sol`, `gpt-6-sol`, `gpt-6-luna` and Claude Opus, Sonnet and Haiku 5.5.
- 5f9980c: `@flow-state-dev/testing` now declares `vitest` as an optional peer dependency. The `@flow-state-dev/testing/conformance` entry point imports `vitest` when it loads, so install `vitest` alongside it to use that subpath; the package root does not need it (FIX-1431).
- 387f95c: Add `findNodeBuiltinsFromEntry` and `findImportsFromEntry`, which walk a source entry's import graph and report every Node built-in (or any import you name) it reaches with the chain that reached it, for guarding browser-safe entry points (FIX-1605).

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- b48158a: Organization identity is now required on every request (FIX-1442).

  A session, request, dispatched child and scheduled job each carry an
  organization, and the server checks it on reads and execution alongside the
  user. It comes from a configured `resolvePrincipal`, or — when an app
  configures no resolver — from the new reserved `DEFAULT_ORG_ID` exported by
  `@flow-state-dev/core`. A caller-supplied `orgId` is never authoritative.

  **What you need to change**

  - A resolver must return a verified `orgId`. Returning none, a blank one, or
    `DEFAULT_ORG_ID` is refused with 401. A machine transport may return
    `{ orgId }` alone and let `defaultUserId` name its system user.
  - Direct `runAction` calls must pass `orgId` — your verified organization, or
    `DEFAULT_ORG_ID` for single-organization development.
  - `authentication.requireOrg` and a block's `requireOrg` are removed.
    Organization is unconditional, so the declaration had nothing left to say;
    a config that still carries either is rejected at definition time rather
    than ignored.
  - Client and React session APIs no longer take an `orgId` — the server owns
    it. `SessionDetail.orgId` is now required on the way back.
  - `openChannels` no longer takes an `orgId`; the server binds the channel.
  - A queued BullMQ job that carries no organization now fails terminally
    instead of being retried: a worker runs below principal resolution, so no
    later attempt could supply one. Subscribers receive an error terminal rather
    than waiting for a job that never completes.

  **The schedule index stores the organization.** `schedule_index` gains a
  nullable `org_id` column in both the SQLite and PostgreSQL adapters, so the
  organization a schedule fires into survives a round trip through the database.
  The column is added for you on the next schema init — there is no manual DDL
  step. Existing rows read back with no organization and are quarantined rather
  than dispatched, so a schedule written before this upgrade does not fire until
  it is attributed; rewriting it stamps the organization of the execution that
  writes it.

  **Upgrading a store with existing data.** Records written before this carry no
  organization. They are preserved and refused (`409 migration-required`) rather
  than guessed at, and listings and scheduler scans skip them. Attribute them
  offline first — the procedure, including dynamic schedules, index rebuild and
  the reserved-id collision check, is in the persistence guide under "Which
  organization a record belongs to".

### Patch Changes

- b56e7d1: Every package can be imported again: 0.1.1 shipped JavaScript whose relative imports were missing the file extensions Node's ESM resolver requires, so importing any 0.1.1 package failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` (FIX-1431).

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- b3e6e22: Initial release (FIX-1187).

### Patch Changes

- ce85e80: Two registered copies of one flow definition can be set up differently: `defineFlow({ configSchema })` declares what a copy may carry, the factory call takes `config`, and blocks read it as `ctx.flow.config` (FIX-1331).
- 5fa52aa: One dispatch protocol: every arrival at a flow — a caller's action, a webhook, a schedule, a task hand-off, an internal dispatch — is a dispatch of one type delivered to one entry addressed by `(type, name)`, with no fallback between types (FIX-1302).

  - **`defineFlow` gains `internal` and `task` entries, nested under their type.** `internal: { actions: { wake: { block } } }` and `task: { actions: { implement: { block } } }` are declared like actions and are definition-only, like the transport maps; the flat `internal: { wake }` / `tasks: { implement }` spelling is refused by name. An `internal` entry is reachable only from a `dispatcher()` inside the flow; a `task` entry is reachable only from a `dispatcher({ type: "task" })` seat on a task board the flow reaches, and `defineFlow` puts each one behind that board's claim gate (the row re-read, the claim verified, the task scope marked, the ticket re-minted) before the block runs. A task entry no board addresses, a task dispatcher no board holds, and two boards addressing one entry are refused at definition. Every entry, of every type, accepts its own `concurrency` (`ActionCore.concurrency`).
  - **`dispatcher()` is the block that sends.** `dispatcher({ name, type: "internal", target, session: { key } | { id }, payload? })` (`InternalDispatcherConfig`) returns a handler carrying its static address, and `defineFlow` refuses an address the flow does not declare — through composition, rescue handlers, and a generator's static `tools`. `{ key }` derives a child session of the running one (minted, then adopted on the same key); `{ id }` delivers into an existing session of the same flow and principal, refuses an unknown id rather than creating one, and is dropped if that session was deleted and recreated between acceptance and the run. A refusal throws `DispatchRefusedError` naming the refusal (`no-entry`, `session-not-found`, `session-not-addressable`, `key-occupied`, `no-dispatch-operation`, `dispatch-rejected`, `external-dispatcher`).
  - **`.forEach()` and `.forEachSideChain()` accept `blocks`.** A per-item factory declares the blocks it can produce, so they are walked for dispatch addresses and merged for resources like a block-shaped call's element. A task board's drain uses it, which is what lets `defineFlow` refuse a flow that reaches a board with a hand-off seat but never declares the entry it addresses.
  - **A task board hands off through a dispatcher seat.** A seat under `workers` is a block; a `dispatcher({ name, type: "task", target, session: "per-task" | "per-worker" | { key: (task) => string } })` (`TaskDispatcherConfig`) in that position hands the seat's rows off to `flow.task.actions[target]` in the child session the policy names. A `task` dispatch carries `{ boardId, seat, taskId, attempt, createdAt, incarnationId?, payload }` (`taskDispatchInputSchema`, `TaskDispatchInput` from core), and the entry's gate re-reads the row and verifies the claim before the block runs. A refused hand-off throws the same `DispatchRefusedError` a `dispatcher()` block throws. An entry a `per-worker` or `key` seat hands off to defaults to `concurrency: "queue"` (an explicit policy wins); a `per-task` seat keeps the flow default. `board.handedOff` lists the seats that hand off; `createTaskGate`, `createHandOff`, `StaleTaskClaimError` and the `TaskSeatRegistry` type are exported from `@flow-state-dev/orchestration/task-board`. `TaskSessionPolicy`, `taskSessionKeyFor`, `bindTaskDispatcher` and `taskBindingOf` are exported from core for substrate code.
  - **A dispatched request is stamped.** It records `metadata.dispatch = { type, target, from, key?, ... }` under `source: "internal"` or `"task"`; the child session it runs in carries `topic` (the key) and `coordinate` (`"<type>:<target>"`) and is listed by `GET /sessions/:sessionId/children` like any other child of its parent.
  - **`task` and `internal` dispatches can never be re-entered** from a public route: retry, continue and resume refuse them, and `publicReentrySources` cannot re-open them.
  - **`createMockTransportHost` publishes `usesExternalDispatcher: false`**, matching the widened `InboundTransportHost` contract.
  - **The dispatch seam is not a named member of the block context** — reach it with `dispatcher()`, or in substrate code with `dispatchThroughSeam` and `markDispatcher`. The Workstream surface this protocol replaces is removed in the same release; see the Workstream-removal note for the renames.

## Pre-1.0 history

Captured from the project's pre-Changesets development log (root `changelog.md`,
deleted on FIX-653). Entries are listed newest-first.

### 2026-05-01 — Tier 1 flow integration test suite (FIX-487)

`mockGenerator` accepts `{ when, then }` predicate entries alongside plain steps. Predicates match by input and stay matchable on every call. `mockGenerator` now simulates the AI SDK's internal multi-step tool loop. `testFlow` accepts an optional `stores: StoreRegistry`; multiple runs sharing the same registry preserve session, journal, and resource state across calls.

### 2026-05-01 — `fsdev run` as primary CLI dev loop (FIX-490)

`@flow-state-dev/testing` no longer re-exports `createInboundTransportConformanceTests` and `createMockTransportHost` from its index — they imported `vitest` at module top level, breaking non-test consumers. Available via the new `@flow-state-dev/testing/conformance` subpath export.

### 2026-04-29 — Inbound transport adapter contract (FIX-438)

Conformance suite for `InboundTransportAdapter` implementations ships in `@flow-state-dev/testing` so future MCP / webhook / scheduled adapters plug into the same harness.

### 2026-04-26 — Org scope rename (FIX-428) [BREAKING]

Test harness seeding renamed `project` → `org`.

### 2026-02-15 — Initial scaffolding

Initial scaffolding: `testBlock`, `testSequencer`, `testRouter`, `testFlow`, `testItems`, `snapshotTrace`, `mockGenerator`. `createMockModelResolver` migrated mocks to the model boundary.
