# @flow-state-dev/workspace

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 71ab534: A workspace host can read a run source's files without a run (FIX-2285). `WorkspaceHost.readSource(answer, request)` is an optional method that lists paths by a glob, reads a range of one file's lines, or searches with grep. `localWorkspaceHost` implements it. It reads a repository from its shared clone at the remote's default branch, never a run's branch. It reads a checkout listed in `localRepositories` at the base a new run there would be cut from, and kept files from their collection. It makes no place. A read fetches the clone at most once a minute and never waits on the clone's lock. Results are capped by `SOURCE_READ_LIMITS` (500 paths; 2,000 lines or 256 KB; 200 matches with 200-character snippets) and say when they were cut. A path that is not a plain repository path is refused as `invalid-path`. `tryAcquireLock` is new: it tries the host's lock once and does not wait. The host now keeps `<root>/.clones/<key>.fetched.json` beside each clone, naming when it was fetched and the default branch and commit that fetch landed on, which reads serve. `run` takes an `onLine` option that hands standard output over line by line instead of buffering it.
- 0d55d46: A session keeps a record of the pull requests it opened (FIX-2268). Core adds the `observed-pull-requests` collection (`observedPullRequestsCollection`), one writer (`writePullRequests`), a replaceable GitHub rule (`githubPullRequestRule`, `DEFAULT_PULL_REQUEST_RULES`) and the recorder: `recordPullRequests(ctx)` for a block, and `pullRequestRecorder()` for a flow with no harness to add as a `.tap` step. A `gh pr create` command or a `create_pull_request` tool whose output holds the link is one row, written as the call settles. Each row carries the `requestId` that opened it.

  The Codex, Claude Code and Cursor blocks record by default; `recordPullRequests: false` turns it off. Workspace adds `recordBranchPullRequests`, a host-side check that asks GitHub through `gh` which pull requests a checkout's branch has. The harness manager declares the record and runs that check before its verdict and when a run fails.

  **Migration.** A Codex, Claude Code or Cursor block now declares the `observed-pull-requests` session collection by default. A test that asserts the block declares no resources must pass `recordPullRequests: false`.

- 06ea781: A checkout handed back off its run's branch is no longer refused. The host moves it back onto the run's branch and keeps what the run made elsewhere: a fast-forward when the checkout's commit contains the branch, and otherwise a checkout of the branch. It reports this as `place.repo.movedBack`. A checkout with uncommitted changes on a branch that lacks the run's commits is handed back as it is and reported as `place.repo.offBranch`, because those changes are the run's to commit, stash or discard; harness-manager refuses that attempt with the message. A half-done git operation, or the branch checked out in another worktree, is refused as the typed `WorkspaceRefusedError` `checkout-moved`, naming the git command that clears it. A run that switches its own branch no longer strands its session (FIX-2211).
- ba74f01: `harnessManager({ workspace })` accepts a workspace host from `@flow-state-dev/workspace` as well as a fixed `{ root, sourceRepo, baseRef }`, and provisions every run through the host either way. A run keeps the repository and base it started on (recorded on its run record) when its source later changes, and a run that started with no repository stays on its kept files. Its kept files are saved at the end of each turn, when it asks a question, and when the harness fails, and a run is not completed while its last save failed. A run its workspace refuses (the source answers `refused`, or the host won't provision the remote) is cancelled on its first attempt instead of being retried, and `HarnessRunRefused` is exported. `localWorkspaceHost` gains `localRepositories`, for a repository on the machine that runs are cut from directly, with no clone and no fetch, and a place request can name a directory the checkout's repository must keep out of git, which a run with no repository also leaves out of its saved files. A provision's `provisionTimeoutMs` now covers its waits for other provisions of the same place or clone, and `save` refuses a place handle that a later provision of the same place has replaced. `run`, `GIT_TIMEOUT_MS` and `CHECKOUT_CLEANUP_TIMEOUT_MS` from `@flow-state-dev/harness-manager/checkout` are now re-exported from `@flow-state-dev/workspace` (FIX-1762).
- 2348dbd: A repository listed in `localRepositories` now fetches the base's upstream and cuts a new run's branch from whichever of local and upstream is newer, refusing a base whose two copies have each moved as `base-diverged` and recording the commit cut at as `place.repo.baseCommit`, which the run record keeps and `readRunCommits` now counts a run's commits from (FIX-1927).
- 9510a03: Requests now carry `ctx.request.incarnation`, a token that stays the same across a request's retries and resumes and that request-scoped workspace keys and local `scope: "run"` bash directories now include, so a request reusing a deleted request's id starts empty; existing run workspaces move once on upgrade, and a run in flight at deploy continues in an empty directory (FIX-1286).
- 57a859d: A workspace host can now hold a repository run's commits and uncommitted files off the machine, and rebuild the checkout on another host. Off by default: pass `heldWork: fileHeldWorkStore({ dir })` (or your own `HeldWorkStore`) to `localWorkspaceHost`, and have the run source answer a `heldPrefix`. `checkpoint(place, recorded?)` now returns the hold (or `null`) instead of nothing; new `dropHeld`, `hostId` and `holds` on the host; `provision` takes the run's `recorded` place and hold, returns `origin`, and rejects with `HeldWorkMismatchError` when held work disagrees with the record. A host without a store rejects a recorded hold with `field: "disabled"` instead of starting the run over (FIX-1766).
- 707b340: Add `localWorkspaceHost`, which turns a run source's answer into a place a worker edits (a fresh branch of an allowed remote in `checkout/` with kept files in `project/`, or kept files alone in `workspace/`) and saves the kept files back, plus a `scope` on `Mount` that confines a projection to one key prefix of its collection (FIX-1762).

### Patch Changes

- 8628a54: `redactRemote` is exported so a caller can show a git remote with its userinfo removed (FIX-1762).
- f2f8527: A repository listed in `localWorkspaceHost`'s `localRepositories` now keeps the remote URLs and branch upstreams the host pinned across restarts, so a run that rewrites the repository's config can't aim a later host's fetch. A remote that no longer matches its pin is not fetched, and the warning names the pin file to delete to accept a deliberate change. A fetch that fails or is skipped now starts the run from the local base instead of the remote-tracking ref (FIX-1934).
- 315f7f3: `projectWorkspace({ checkouts })` runs a listed shared project's coding runs in worktrees of a checkout on the server's machine, with the project's kept files beside each worktree, which `localWorkspaceHost`'s `localRepositories` now supports (FIX-1906).
- c4d14f6: The local workspace host no longer runs the repository's git hooks while it makes or hands back a checkout (`-c core.hooksPath=/dev/null` on its worktree git calls). A `post-checkout` hook that builds, such as `pnpm packages:build`, used to fail `git worktree add` in the fresh tree and fail the provision with it (FIX-1947).

## 0.0.0

- Initial release. The file projection between resource collections and
  wherever an agent works: `createProjection({ mounts, place })` hydrates
  mounted collections into a place and flushes them back, reporting an
  outcome for every path it reached. A path two writers touched comes back
  as a `conflict` carrying what the projection last committed, what the
  collection holds, and what the place holds — the three values needed to
  tell "I changed this" from "somebody else changed this". Ships
  `createHostPlace` (a real directory, contained, symlinks neither listed
  nor followed) and `createMemoryPlace` (a `Map`, for tests).
